# Welcome to StudySphere
Created for EducateHacks 2024

## Inspiration
The inspiration for StudySphere came from the difficulty of understanding and retaining complex subjects using traditional study methods. I wanted to create a tool that would help students visualize and understand concepts more effectively.

## What it does
StudySphere is an AI-based study tool that generates unique and insightful mind maps to help you learn concepts, rather than cram formulas. Based on OpenAI's API and a react.js interface, the web app builds generates an interactive and moveable mind map from a simple user prompt.

## How I built it
I used React.js and HTML to build an interactive user interface for StudySphere. The backend was implemented using JavaScript and Express.js to interact with OpenAI's API. The frontend and backend communicate via HTTP requests.

## Challenges I ran into
One of the main challenges I encountered was properly parsing and organizing the output from the OpenAI API into a structured mind map format. Additionally, ensuring the user interface was intuitive and responsive presented its own set of challenges.

## Accomplishments I'm proud of
I'm proud of successfully integrating OpenAI's API into the project and creating a user-friendly interface that allows users to easily generate and interact with mind maps. Overcoming the technical challenges and seeing the project come together was very rewarding.

## What I learned
Through building StudySphere, I gained experience working with React.js and learned how to effectively integrate third-party APIs into web applications. I also improved my skills in frontend and backend development and gained insights into the field of AI-based education tools.

## What's next for StudySphere
In the future, I plan to enhance StudySphere by adding features such as user authentication, saving and sharing mind maps, and improving the AI model for generating more accurate and detailed mind maps. I also aim to optimize the performance and scalability of the application to accommodate a larger user base.
